# gameDay

Fist Javascript application made during my DigitalCrafts bootcamp. When visiting the site users will be presented the college football schedule for the upcoming weekend and the weather information for the location. Using the FantasyData API we gather all of the info needed to display to the page for each game. Then taking the stadium name, city and state a call is made to the Google geocode Api the longitue and latitude is found. Then the longitude and latitude is sent to the Dark Sky API to find the weather for the upcoming game.
